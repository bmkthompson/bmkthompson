👋🏽 Hello! I'm Brandon Thompson, a data-driven student with a strong interest in applying mathematics, probability, and statistics to analyze complex systems and make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Core Interests:
I'm particularly drawn to probabilistic systems — environments where uncertainty dominates, but careful analysis can uncover hidden structure and statistical edges. Whether it's analyzing financial markets, studying game theory, or building trading models, I enjoy exploring randomness to find patterns that can be quantified and potentially exploited.

📊 Current Focus Areas:

- Financial Markets & Quantitative Research
- Probabilistic Modeling & Statistical Inference
- Data Science & Analytics
- Applied Game Theory (including poker strategy analysis)
- Data Visualization (Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Python Development (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)

🃏 Other Interests:
Outside of financial data, I enjoy studying poker strategy for its strong overlap with probability, risk management, and decision-making under uncertainty — much like trading and investing.

🧮 Academic Background:
Currently completing my undergraduate degree in Mathematics, specializing in Probability and Statistics, with an increasing focus on applying these concepts to financial data science and trading models.

📈 Selected Projects:

- Statistical arbitrage research platform that identifies potentially cointegrated stock pairs, generates trading signals, and evaluates performance through custom backtesting models.

- Tableau and Python data visualization projects to analyze market data, performance metrics, and portfolio behavior.

🚀 Next Goals:
Further developing my skills in machine learning, algorithmic trading, and data-driven decision-making in probabilistic environments.
